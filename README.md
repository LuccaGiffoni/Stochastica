# Stochastica

This repository is dedicated to the implementation of the Stochastica application, developed as part of a proposed challenge. The application is a tool for simulating Brownian motion, commonly used in finance to model the stochastic behavior of prices.

## Proposal

The purpose of the Stochastica application is to provide a user-friendly and functional interface for simulating Brownian motion, allowing users to configure various parameters and view the results clearly and intuitively.

## Enhancements

In addition to the minimum challenge requirements, the following enhancements have been implemented:

- **Scale System:** Added vertical and horizontal scales to the graph to facilitate result interpretation.
- **Multiple Simulations:** Users can now simulate multiple outcomes, defining the desired number of simulations and viewing all lines on the same graph.
- **Enhanced Components:** Components such as steppers and sliders have been used for parameter input, improving the user experience.
- **Visual Customization:** Users can visually customize the graph by choosing the number of plot lines and using an automatic contrasting color selection system.
- **Improved Responsiveness:** The application was developed with a focus on responsiveness, ensuring a consistent experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Standards and Best Practices

The implementation of the Stochastica application strictly follows these standards and best practices:

- Use of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for clear separation of responsibilities and a modular, scalable architecture.
- Adoption of Microsoft's design guidelines to ensure a consistent and user-friendly interface.
- Compliance with .NET coding standards to ensure code readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Implementation of unit tests using frameworks such as NUnit or MSTest to ensure software quality and facilitate regression detection.
- Use of comments in the code to explain the logic, making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain.
